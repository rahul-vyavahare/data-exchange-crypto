Created a table that shows the following data.   



Symbol
Description
Underlying Asset
Mark Price



Usinge the API https://api.delta.exchange/v2/products to fetch the initial data required.  only the first 3 columns from this API 
These are the field names respectively symbol, description, underlying_asset.symbol 

Mark Price has to update from a socket channel. 
Created a socket connection using the URL wss://production-esocket.delta.exchange. 
After a successful connection, subscribe to a channel called v2/ticker. 
Inorder to make a successful subscription, you will have to send the array of product symbols as the payload (Ex: {name: "v2/ticker", symbols: ["BTCUSD", "BTCUSDT"]}). 
You will then get the required data, you can use a field called mark_price in the response. 
You can refer to the documentation for more information https://docs.delta.exchange/#v2-ticker 

The first column of the table and the header has to be sticky on scroll

due to CORS issue from delta.exchange server its not working on deployed app but its working on lochalhost
 link for working localhost app

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
